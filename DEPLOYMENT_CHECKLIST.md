- [ ] Vercel URL obtained

### Step 4: Final Configuration
- [ ] Update `CLIENT_URL` in Railway to match Vercel URL
- [ ] Test all functionality:
  - [ ] User registration/login
  - [ ] Chat functionality
  - [ ] File upload
  - [ ] Real-time messaging
  - [ ] API health check

## üê≥ Alternative: Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Docker installed
- [ ] Docker Compose installed
- [ ] `.env` file created from `.env.docker` template
- [ ] All environment variables configured in `.env`

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Build and start containers (`npm run docker:prod`)
- [ ] Verify all services are running (`docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps`)
- [ ] Test application at `http://localhost:5000`

## üîç Post-Deployment Testing

### Backend Health Check

- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] API endpoints responding correctly

### Frontend Functionality
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Chat interface loads
- [ ] Messages send and receive
- [ ] File upload works
- [ ] Real-time features work (Socket.IO)
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle works

### Performance & Security
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (production)
- [ ] CORS configured correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting working
- [ ] File upload size limits enforced
- [ ] JWT authentication working
- [ ] Error handling working properly

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### CORS Errors
- [ ] Verify `CLIENT_URL` matches frontend domain exactly
- [ ] Check environment variables in both Railway and Vercel
- [ ] Ensure no trailing slashes in URLs

### Database Connection Issues
- [ ] Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string
- [ ] Check IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Ensure database user has correct permissions

### Socket.IO Connection Issues
- [ ] Verify `VITE_SOCKET_URL` matches backend URL
- [ ] Check Railway logs for WebSocket errors
- [ ] Ensure Socket.IO transports are configured correctly

### API Key Issues
- [ ] Verify API keys are correctly set
- [ ] Check API key permissions and quotas
- [ ] Test API keys with simple requests

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- [ ] Monitor Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs
- [ ] Monitor MongoDB Atlas metrics
- [ ] Check API usage and quotas
- [ ] Monitor application performance

### Updates
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Monitor security advisories
- [ ] Regular backup of database
- [ ] Test deployment process regularly
